    <h1>Reflecting on the things I have learnt from this short exercise:</h1>
    <h2>Thoughts:</h2>
    <p>I realized that there is so much more depth to JavaScript; so many things that I do not know about or am not familiar with. This is going to be my motivation to learn more about JavaScript and ES6 (template literals seem really useful)! Though I find JavaScript to be slightly tough, I believe that with more time and effort put into it, I will be able to enjoy working with it. I hope that after this 30 days of JavaScript projects, I will be able to familiarise myself with how to manipulate DOM elements with JavaScript, as well creating functions and hopefully, stop overcomplicating my code. I will be doing this along with learning JavaScript form Udemy courses. Hopefully soon, I will be able to try my hands on the project and get it to work before watching the video to get alternative solutions!</p>

    <h2>What I learnt about JavaScript:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The transitionend event: I think this is one of the more impactful things I have learnt today. I think I can apply this quite a bit in the future.</li>
        <li>Making use of template literals: Introduced to it before, but never realized how awesome it is up till now! Will be reading and experimenting with it.</li>
        <li>Making use of keydown and data keys: This is the first time I have done this. I will be trying out more things with it, perhaps by building my own keycode checker!</li>
        <li>Arrow functions: (I really need to start remembering things!!)</li>
    </ul>
