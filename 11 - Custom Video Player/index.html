<!---actually managed to implement the fullscreen function on my own!! well, of course i copied the CSS code for the fullscreen, still trying to digest it... but I did the javascript ;-; honestly proud

learned a lot about HTML video element and how we can interact with it. this also gave me a greater perspective as to how vanilla javascript can interact with the DOM, probably one of the more fun exercises I have ever done! -->
